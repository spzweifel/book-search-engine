# book-search-engine

![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

A Google Books API search engine built with React.

## Description

In this project, I was presented with starter code for a book searching app. I modified the code so that a user can now search for books, add/remove them from their profile, and sign up and log in. It is using both Apollo, React, and a MongoDB database.
